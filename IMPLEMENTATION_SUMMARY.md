# Event Attendance Synchronization - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
Fixed the issue where users could register twice for the same event after app reinstall due to:
1. Personal calendar not being synchronized with user's event attendances from database
2. UI showing "Join" button for events user was already attending

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Synchronization Method (`CommunityEventsProvider`)
- **File**: `lib/providers/community_events_provider.dart`
- **Method**: `syncAttendedEventsToCalendar(EventProvider eventProvider)`
- **Purpose**: Automatically populates personal calendar with events user is already attending
- **Logic**:
  - Fetches user's attendances from `event_attendees` table
  - Gets corresponding community event details
  - Creates personal calendar events for attended events not already in calendar
  - Avoids duplicates by checking existing calendar events

### 2. App Initialization Hook (`AppEntry`)
- **File**: `lib/app_entry.dart`
- **Method**: `_syncUserAttendedEvents()`
- **Purpose**: Calls synchronization on app startup
- **Timing**: Uses `addPostFrameCallback` to ensure providers are initialized

### 3. Events Screen Enhancement
- **File**: `lib/screens/events_screen.dart`
- **Method**: `_loadEventsAndSync()`
- **Purpose**: Ensures sync happens when events screen loads
- **Benefit**: Provides additional synchronization opportunity

### 4. UI Improvements
- **File**: `lib/screens/events_screen.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Button text: "Going" → "Cancel" (clearer intent)
  - Button color: Orange → Red (indicates cancel action)
  - Existing functionality preserved (cancel still works)

### 5. Comprehensive Tests
- **Files**: 
  - `test/event_attendance_sync_test.dart` - Tests sync logic
  - `test/event_cancel_attendance_test.dart` - Tests cancel functionality
- **Coverage**: Event creation, duplicate detection, state management, UI logic

## How It Works

### On App Launch/Reinstall:
1. User authenticates
2. `AppEntry.initState()` triggers `_syncUserAttendedEvents()`
3. `CommunityEventsProvider.syncAttendedEventsToCalendar()` runs:
   - Queries `event_attendees` table for user's attendances
   - Fetches corresponding community events
   - Creates personal calendar events for missing ones
   - Avoids duplicates

### On Events Screen:
1. Loads community events with attendance status
2. Triggers additional sync to ensure calendar is current
3. UI shows correct button state based on `isUserAttending`

### Cancel Attendance:
1. User clicks "Cancel" button (red)
2. `CommunityEventsProvider.leaveEvent()` executes:
   - Removes from `event_attendees` table
   - Decrements event attendance count
   - Removes matching personal calendar events
   - Updates UI state

## Key Features

### Automatic Synchronization
- ✅ Personal calendar automatically populated on app launch
- ✅ Handles app reinstalls and data loss scenarios
- ✅ Non-blocking background operation

### Duplicate Prevention
- ✅ Checks for existing calendar events before creating
- ✅ Matches by title and date for accuracy
- ✅ Handles edge cases (multiple matches, missing events)

### User Experience
- ✅ Clear "Cancel" button for attended events
- ✅ Red color indicates cancel action
- ✅ Immediate UI feedback on attendance changes
- ✅ Calendar automatically updated

### Data Integrity
- ✅ Database and calendar stay synchronized
- ✅ Handles authentication edge cases
- ✅ Graceful error handling

## Manual Testing Guide

### Test Scenario 1: Fresh App Install
1. Install app and login
2. Join several events through Events screen
3. Verify events appear in personal calendar
4. Uninstall and reinstall app
5. Login again
6. **Expected**: Events still show "Cancel" button (red)
7. **Expected**: Personal calendar shows attended events

### Test Scenario 2: Cancel Attendance
1. Navigate to Events screen
2. Find event with "Cancel" button (red)
3. Tap "Cancel"
4. **Expected**: Button changes to "Join" (orange)
5. **Expected**: Event removed from personal calendar
6. **Expected**: Attendance count decreases

### Test Scenario 3: Join Event
1. Find event with "Join" button (orange) 
2. Tap "Join"
3. **Expected**: Button changes to "Cancel" (red)
4. **Expected**: Event added to personal calendar
5. **Expected**: Attendance count increases

### Test Scenario 4: Full Event
1. Find event that is full (currentAttendees >= maxAttendees)
2. **Expected**: Button shows "Full" (grey) and is disabled
3. **Expected**: Cannot join full event

## Error Handling

### Network Issues
- Sync operations handle connectivity problems gracefully
- UI remains functional even if sync fails
- Debug logging available for troubleshooting

### Authentication Edge Cases
- Sync skipped if user not authenticated
- No errors thrown for unauthenticated access
- Clean handling of auth state changes

### Data Consistency
- Duplicate events prevented by matching logic
- Orphaned calendar events cleaned up on cancel
- Database constraints prevent invalid attendances

## Performance Considerations

### Efficient Queries
- Uses Supabase filtering to minimize data transfer
- Only syncs events user is actually attending
- Avoids unnecessary database operations

### Background Processing
- Sync runs in background without blocking UI
- Uses `addPostFrameCallback` for proper timing
- Non-blocking error handling

### Memory Management
- Minimal additional memory overhead
- Leverages existing provider architecture
- Clean disposal of resources
