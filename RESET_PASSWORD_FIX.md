# Reset Password Token Issue - Release Build Fix

## Problem
Reset password functionality works in debug mode but fails in release APK builds. The issue manifests as tokens not being sent to email addresses, making password reset impossible for users in production.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Silent Error Handling
- Release builds suppress debug-only logging, making errors invisible
- Network failures and API errors were not being properly tracked
- Users couldn't see what was actually failing

### 2. Network Connectivity Issues
- No pre-validation of internet connectivity before API calls
- No specific checks for Supabase endpoint reachability
- Inadequate error messages for network-related failures

### 3. Supabase Initialization Problems
- Minimal error handling during Supabase client initialization
- App continues to function even if Supabase fails to initialize
- No visibility into initialization status

### 4. ProGuard/R8 Obfuscation
- Potential class obfuscation affecting HTTP clients and Supabase SDK
- Missing rules for newer Supabase auth and networking components

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Release-Compatible Logging (`lib/services/release_logger.dart`)
- Added comprehensive logging service that works in both debug and release modes
- Stores logs in SharedPreferences for later analysis
- Provides error tracking with timestamps and stack traces
- Enables debugging production issues without debug mode

### 2. Network Connectivity Service (`lib/services/network_connectivity_service.dart`)
- Pre-validates internet connectivity before making API calls
- Specifically tests Supabase endpoint reachability
- Provides detailed error messages for different network failure scenarios
- Prevents API calls when network is unavailable

### 3. Enhanced Auth Service Error Handling
- Added comprehensive logging to all password reset methods
- Improved network connectivity checks before API calls
- Better error message classification and user feedback
- Enhanced timeout handling with specific error messages

### 4. Improved Supabase Initialization (`lib/main.dart`)
- Enhanced error handling during Supabase client initialization
- Detailed logging of initialization failures with specific error types
- Status tracking to identify when Supabase is not properly initialized
- Graceful degradation when initialization fails

### 5. Updated ProGuard Rules (`android/app/proguard-rules.pro`)
- Added comprehensive rules for Supabase auth components
- Enhanced HTTP client and networking library preservation
- Better JSON serialization and reflection support
- Improved SSL/TLS and networking security rules

### 6. Debug Access in Release Builds (`lib/screens/debug_logs_screen.dart`)
- Added secret debug screen accessible via long-press in account settings
- Allows viewing, sharing, and clearing of logs in release builds
- Enables field debugging and user support
- Provides insights into exactly what's failing in production

## Implementation Details

### Key Features Added:

1. **Comprehensive Error Tracking**: Every auth operation now logs detailed information
2. **Network Pre-validation**: Checks connectivity before attempting API calls
3. **Release-Mode Debugging**: Debug screen accessible without debug mode
4. **Enhanced Error Messages**: User-friendly messages with specific failure reasons
5. **Robust ProGuard Rules**: Prevents obfuscation of critical networking components

### Usage for Debugging:

1. **Access Debug Logs**: Long-press "Biometric Authentication" in Account Settings
2. **Share Logs**: Use share button to send logs for analysis
3. **Clear Logs**: Clear old logs to focus on current issues
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Logs are written immediately during operations

## Testing Instructions

### Before Release:
1. Build release APK with new changes
2. Test password reset functionality on physical device
3. Check debug logs for any errors or issues
4. Verify network connectivity handling
5. Test in various network conditions (WiFi, mobile data, poor connection)

### Debug Process:
1. Trigger password reset in release build
2. Access debug logs via long-press in account settings
3. Share logs to analyze specific failure points
4. Check for network, initialization, or API errors

## Expected Outcomes

With these fixes, the release build should:

1. **Properly send reset tokens** to email addresses
2. **Provide clear error messages** when failures occur
3. **Allow debugging** of production issues through log access
4. **Handle network failures gracefully** with user-friendly messages
5. **Work consistently** across debug and release builds
