# Password Reset Changes Verification

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Removed Lottie Animation from Success Page
- Removed `Lottie.asset()` widget from `_buildResetCompleteContent()`
- Added extra spacing (50px) instead of animation
- Removed unused `import 'package:lottie/lottie.dart';`

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Password Validation Order
- Modified `updatePassword()` method to validate passwords BEFORE verifying token
- Added explicit password validation checks:
  - Empty password check
  - Minimum 6 characters check
  - Password confirmation matching check
- Only calls `updatePasswordWithToken()` after all password validations pass
- Prevents one-time token consumption when password validation fails

### 3. ✅ Added Logout After Password Reset
- Modified "Back to login" button in success page
- Now calls `auth.signOut()` before navigating back
- Ensures user must log in with new password instead of being automatically logged in

### 4. ✅ Centered Text on Success Page
- Removed Row wrappers around title and description text
- Added proper padding for description text
- Both title and description now use `textAlign: TextAlign.center`

### 5. ✅ Updated Button Colors to Black
- Changed all buttons in password reset flow to use `Colors.black` background
- Updated buttons in:
  - Email entry form: "Reset Password"
  - Email sent form: "Proceed"
  - Token entry form: "Back" and "Reset Password"
  - New password form: "Back" and "Reset Password"
  - Success page: "Back to login" (already was black)

### 6. ✅ Updated Tests
- Added `signOut()` method to MockAuthService
- Updated test structure to accommodate new functionality

## Code Changes Summary

### Key Methods Modified:
1. `updatePassword()` - Enhanced password validation
2. `_buildResetCompleteContent()` - Removed animation, centered text, added logout
3. All button widgets - Changed to black background

### Files Modified:
- `lib/auth/reset_password.dart` - Main implementation
- `test/token_reset_password_test.dart` - Test updates

## Expected Behavior After Changes:
1. **Password validation flow**: Form validates passwords locally before consuming the reset token
2. **Success page**: Clean, centered text without animation
3. **Logout behavior**: User is signed out and must log in with new password
4. **Consistent styling**: All buttons are black with white text

All requirements from the problem statement have been implemented.
